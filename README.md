### Yet another mell-o-tron
Hi, here's what you (probably don't) need to know about me:
- I'm a computer science student, and although what I study has got "computer" in the name, I'm more of a fan of books (especially maths ones...) than one of electronic devices. "Computers are to CS what telescopes are to astronomy" or something, as The Shortest Path Guy once said.
- I like music, all kinds of music, as long as it's written to benefit the spirit, and not the wallet. I change "favourite genre" almost weekly, but a couple of things certainly won't change: my favourite singer is Chet Baker, and if a song is about love, I will most likely like it. I play a couple of instruments, too, but my career as a musician has always been limited by my lack of "being a good musician"-ness. 
- My spirit/wallet preference principle also applies to code, books and any form of content.
- I love biscuits, I bake biscuits, I eat biscuits: the crunchy, the soft, the plain, the fancy, the chocolate-coated, the dunked in tea, coffee or milk; I love biscuits!
